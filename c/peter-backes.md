# Peter Backes

Reads tokenized GFA BASIC version 3.x source files (.GFA) and converts them to human readable ASCII listings (.LST).

This is a fixed version of the original ONS tool available at:\
http://titan.plasma.xg8.de:8080/\~rtc/

It can be used along with git to get text diffs on GFA files (but not merges):

```
# make sure you have gfalist in your $PATH

$ git diff
diff --git a/test.gfa b/test.gfa
index 9dfbbd6..b8612d8 100644
Binary files a/test.gfa and b/test.gfa differ
$ git config --local diff.gfa.textconv 'gfalist -c'
$ echo '*.gfa diff=gfa' >> .gitattributes
$ git diff
diff --git a/test.gfa b/test.gfa
index 9dfbbd6..b8612d8 100644
--- a/test.gfa
+++ b/test.gfa
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+QUIT 0
```

See \[http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes#Binary-Files]\(the git book) for more info on using text filters and difftools on binary files with git.
