# CHART

This project provides a library of simple chart drawing functions for\
Atari C programmers. The code is written to be embedded into an\
existing project. The code was written for[AHCC](http://members.chello.nl/h.robbers/),\
but may work with other C compilers with minor modifications.

## Use

Include the files chart.h and chart.c in your own project.

Read chart.h for a description of the available functions.

The file example.c illustrates all functions in the library.

When compiling on a Firebee, include the compiler flag PMARKS, to use\
the library's built in pmarker code.

## Functionality

Three types of chart are supported:

1. Bar Charts: A set of positive values is converted into a series of vertical   \
   bars. The title, x/y labels, colours and fill patterns of bars may be   \
   altered.
2. Line Charts: A set of lines added to a line chart. The title, x/y labels,   \
   and colour, line style and point style may all be altered.
3. Pie Charts: A set of positive values is converted into slices of a pie   \
   chart. The title, slice labels, colours and fill patterns may be altered.
